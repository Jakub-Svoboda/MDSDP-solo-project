Ideas

## Syntax
- item { property=value; other=somethingelse }
  - this might be easiest to do inline, but we could also declare them separately with the properties
  - I currently believe it looks neatest with them inline

## Samples
- [Link to declared example](https://github.com/Zenthurion/MDSD-Project/blob/master/DSL%20Proposals/login.gui)
- [Link to inline example](https://github.com/Zenthurion/MDSD-Project/blob/master/DSL%20Proposals/login-inline.gui)
- The idea is that these compose something like the below image

## Features


## Layout Components
- layout
- vertical
- horizontal
- grid (with a width and height)
- rows or columns (in essence the same as grid, but with one dimension unspecified)

## Controls
- button
- slider
- form (invisible but enables grouped validation - alternative name could be validation-group?)
- label
- toggle
- checkbox
- radio buttons (this will be interesting...)
- input fields
  - email
  - password
  - number
  - date
